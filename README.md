# Basic Firewall Simulation in Python

This repository contains a simple Python-based firewall simulation. It is designed to demonstrate basic concepts of network traffic filtering based on IP addresses and ports. The firewall rules are defined within the script and can be modified to simulate different filtering behaviors.

## Features

- **IP and Port Filtering**: Simulates blocking or allowing traffic based on predefined firewall rules involving IP addresses and ports.
- **Logging**: Logs all firewall decisions to a file, aiding in future audits and security analysis.
- **Random Traffic Simulation**: Generates random IP addresses and ports to simulate network traffic and test the firewall's configuration.

## Installation

No external libraries are required to run this simulation as it uses standard Python libraries. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Usage

To run the firewall simulation, simply clone this repository and run the script from your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FrenchPhalange/fake_firewall.git
cd le-meilleur-firewall
python firewall.py
